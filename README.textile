h1. Rails Indexes

Rails indexes is a small package of 2 rake tasks that scan your application models and displays a list of columns that _probably_ should be indexed.

Note: there may be more fields depending on your application design and custom queries.

h2. Installation

as a rails plugin:
<pre>script/plugin install git://github.com/eladmeidar/rails_indexes.git</pre>

h2. Usage

Display a migration for adding/removing all necessary indexes based on associations:
<pre>rake db:index_migration</pre>

Display a migration for adding/removing all necessary indexes based on AR::Base#find calls (including: find, find_by, find_all_by, find_by_x_and_y, find_all_by_x_and_y):
<pre>rake db:find_query_indexes</pre>

Note that it would probably make more sense running those tasks on production, where you *actually* need those indexes to be added.

h2. Tests

Requires SQLite3 installed, then just:
<pre>rake</pre>
to run the tests
